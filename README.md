**Experiences and Strengths: Explain how this course will help you in reaching your professional goals.**
Many companies now are looking for candiates with AWS experience. Learning how things work as a developer for AWS will help me in becoming a more qualified candidate
**What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?**
I have learned all the thing I need to create an AWS website, additionally I have learned more about Docker than I knew before which is also a very popular software in the development world
**Describe your strengths as a software developer.**
I am relentless. I will prusue a problem until I have found a workable solution that is easy to impliment.
**Identify the types of roles you are prepared to assume in a new job.**
Since I am only just graduating, a junior developer role in node .js, c++, or ruby. I also have the skill set to be a full-stack developer
**Planning for Growth: Synthesize the knowledge you have gathered about cloud services.**
Cloud services are much better than hosting the website yourself as the upkeep is low.
**Identify various ways that microservices or serverless may be used to produce efficiencies of management and scale in your web application in the future. Consider the following:**
*How would you handle scale and error handling?*
For scalability utilizing AWS is very beneficial, in terms of error handling, specific code funtions typically handle these sorts of things
*How would you predict the cost?*
Cost can be hard to predict in terms of serverless as the more users accessing your website the higher the cost. However if you assume that your website will have an average number of users I'm sure the cost would be under $50 a month with AWS
**What is more cost predictable, containers or serverless?**
Containers, as the cost is fixed and upfront, the only other thing you would need to factor in is electricity costs.
**Explain several pros and cons that would be deciding factors in plans for expansion.**
Pros for AWS is easily scalability, the cons would be unreliable pricing as your website could get big over night and you would be left with a very hefty bill from AWS.
**What roles do elasticity and pay-for-service play in decision making for planned future growth?**
Elasticity and pay-for-service plans are good as in the beggining the costs are very cheap, however you must set aside a hefty budget the bigger your website gets.
